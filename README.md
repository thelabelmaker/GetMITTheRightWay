# GetMIT!
A fork of https://github.com/mitchgu/GetMIT, which is a small clone of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) by Gabrielle Cirulli and [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Made just to poke fun at MIT; no hard feelings to other colleges! [Play it here!](http://mitchellgu.github.io/GetMIT/)
